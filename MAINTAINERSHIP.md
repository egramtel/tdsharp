Instructions for Maintainers
============================

Publish a New Version
---------------------

1. Choose a new version. To avoid confusion, all the packages should follow the versioning of the upstream Telegram library, and should have the same version among them.
2. Update the copyright year in [the license file][license], if required.
3. Update the copyright year in the `Directory.Build.props`, if required.
4. Prepare a corresponding entry in [the changelog][changelog] (usually by renaming the "Unreleased" section).
5. Set the `<Version>` in the `Directory.Build.props`.
6. Merge all the changes to the main branch using a pull request.
7. Make sure the NuGet keys you use for publishing are still active. If not, then rotate the keys as explained in the corresponding section of this document.
8. Push a tag in form of `v<VERSION>`, e.g. `v0.0.1`. GitHub Actions will do the rest (push the NuGet packages).
9. If the release is not synchronized with a corresponding release of [tdlib.native][], then it's recommended to [unlist][docs.unlist] it until the corresponding release of tdlib.native is available. This will help the users to do a coordinated update and not update only a part of the libraries.

Rotate Keys
-----------

CI relies on NuGet API keys being added to the secrets. From time to time, these keys require maintenance: they will become obsolete and will have to be updated.

To update the keys:

1. Sign in onto nuget.org.
2. Go to the [API keys][nuget.api-keys] section.
3. Create a new key with permission to **Push only new package versions** and only allowed to publish **TDLib** package. Name it `github-actions.tdlib`.
4. Create a new key with same permission and only allowed to publish **TDLib.Api** package. Name it `github-actions.tdlib.api`.
5. Paste the generated API keys to the [action secrets][github.secrets] section on GitHub settings (update the `NUGET_KEY_TDLIB` and `NUGET_KEY_TDLIB_API` secrets).

Update Telegram API
-------------------

1. Update the `$CommitHash` variable in the `Scripts/Get-TlFiles.ps1` to a fresh commit hash.
2. Run script `Scripts/Get-TlFiles.ps1` to download the API definitions.
3. Delete the directories `Objects` and `Functions` from the `TdLib.Api` project.
4. Run the following shell script to regenerate the C# code:
   ```console
   $ cd TdLib.Api && dotnet run --project ../TdLib.CodeGen
   ```
